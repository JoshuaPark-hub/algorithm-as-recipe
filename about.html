    <h2>About the Project</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Algorithm as Recipe</em> is a web-based project that reinterprets digital algorithms as culinary recipes.
      While algorithms are often perceived as abstract and invisible systems, this project translates them into
      readable, step-by-step instructions to make their structure visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recipes and algorithms share a fundamental similarity: both are sets of instructions designed to transform
      inputs into outcomes. A recipe transforms ingredients into a dish. An algorithm transforms data into decisions.
      Through this analogy, the project reframes computational processes in a familiar and accessible format.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Conceptual Framework</h2>

    <p>
      The project is grounded in a structural comparison between culinary recipes and computational algorithms.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Recipe Component</th>
        <th>Algorithm Equivalent</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Ingredients</td>
        <td>Data</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Steps</td>
        <td>Code / Instructions</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Kitchen</td>
        <td>Platform Infrastructure</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cook</td>
        <td>Automated System</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dish</td>
        <td>User Experience</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">
      By adopting the familiar format of a cookbook, the project emphasizes how algorithmic systems are structured,
      repeatable, and operational rather than mysterious.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
      Each algorithm was developed through research into documented platform behaviors and personalization systems.
      The process involved analyzing platform logic, abstracting it into simplified steps, and rewriting it into
      a procedural “recipe” format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interface design intentionally mimics cookbook layouts and index structures. The grid system,
      card components, and neutral palette reinforce clarity and systematic organization.
    </p>

    <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      Algorithms operate as invisible infrastructures shaping social, cultural, and economic interactions.
      By presenting them as recipes, this project questions their perceived neutrality and transparency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Who writes the recipe? Who benefits from the final dish? Who becomes the ingredient?
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Algorithm as Recipe</em> invites viewers to reconsider their role within digital platforms:
      Are we cooks following instructions, or are we the ingredients being processed?
